# TwoSwitchSim
A C++ Discrete-Event Network Simulator for two cascading switches, developed for the "Network Simulation" PhD course at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studied - Pisa

# How to use
1) Compile the simulator with:
```
make
```
2) Create an input.txt file containing the parameters defined as in input_template.txt (follow the syntax exactly to avoid parsing errors), such as inter-arrival time, service times, number of packets to process and queue size limit
3) Run the simulations with:
```
./main
```
4) Read the result in output.txt
